# tiled-binary-extension

 Javascript extension for Tiled to export plain tile data.
 
I searched the web to find something to just export tile numbers in a tilemap, in binary. Could not find anything.

So, I made my own!

I hope it works for you. Let me know if there are any issues.

Feel free to fork it or whatever you want! I don't care! I'm not .. Wonder woman, Nick! XD

Windows
